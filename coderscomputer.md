# What is a text editor?

*A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
What features should you look for in a text editor? I would say some
of the most important features are: 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax
highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them. You might find some other
features that are must-have’s, but I think these features are a good
start.
A great feature of any text editing software is code completion. Code
completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing
you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.*

# Using The Software That Already

Comes With Your Computer
Now that we’ve talked about some of the features one might be
interested in if they were interested in a text editor. Let’s talk about
some of your options—beginning with the software that comes on
your computer.
Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac
computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called,
“Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with
your computer is called, “Notepad.”
And on Linux computers, each distribution will have its own text
editor already installed but which one might depend on the flavor of
your particular distribution. These text editors will go by different
names. One distro might have “Gedit,” and others might have other
titles. Check you list of applications to see which text editor comes
with your distribution of Linux.
Since these text editors already come on your computers, why should
you download yet another text editor that does essentially the same
thing as the text editor that you already have? There are other text
editors that have features that you may be interested in, like the ones
we discussed before. Usually, the text editors that come on your
computer don’t have many features to speak of. They’re the barest
bare bones text editors you’ll encounter

# Third-Party Options
Ok, what about third-party options? Let’s talk about software like:
Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom,
Brackets, and Sublime Text. These text editors can all be downloaded
and installed to your computer from their respective websites. Each
of these titles do have some if not all of the features that we talked
about earlier, and most of this software is absolutely free! They are
widely used in web development today. some of them are

- NotePad++
- TextWrangler/BB Edit
- Visual Studio Code and
- Atom
