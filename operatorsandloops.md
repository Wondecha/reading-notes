## Operators and loops

- Cpmarison operators evaluate conditions by comparing two values

- logical operatots allow us to compare the results of more than one comparison operator

## Loops

- loops check a condition. if it returns true, a block of code will run. then the condition will be checked again if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condion returns false

### There are three types of loops

1. for loops
2. while loops
3. do..while loops
