# Process that we can use when creating a new website

## Who is the site for
-Every website should be designed for the
target audience—not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.


## Why people visit your website
Now that you know who your visitors are, you
need to consider why they are coming. While
some people will simply chance across your
website, most will visit for a specific reason.

-Are they looking for general
entertainment or do they
need to achieve a specific
goal?
-If there is a specific goal, is
it a personal or professional
one?
-Do they see spending time on
this activity as essential or a
luxury?
