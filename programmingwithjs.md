## What is a script

- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal
- To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it
- Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically

## Expressiond

- An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE

- Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. some of them are

1. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
2. COMPARISON OPERATORS
3. LOGICAL OPERATORS
4. STRING OPERATORS
5. and ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

## Functions

- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

- To declare a function, you give it a name and write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces

- Executing all the statements of the function between the curly braces with one line of code is known as calling a function
