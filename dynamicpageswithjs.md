## javascript files

-This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interact ivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files.

There are three layers that form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called progressive enhancement.

### HTML ONLY

Starting with the HTML layer allows you to focus on the most important thing about your site

### HTML+CSS

Adding the CSS rules in a separate file keeps rules regarding how the page looks away from the content itself.

### HTML+CSS+JAVASCRIPT

The JavaScript is added last and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the site.

JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script

When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML <script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script. Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.

You may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening <script> and closing </script> tags (but it is better to put scripts in their own files).
