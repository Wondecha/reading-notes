# HOW COMPUTERS WORK

computers in common:

-Take input
-store the input information
-process it
-and output the result

These characterstics are what make a computer a computer

It is by the 20th century that computers start using electrical components instead of mechanical labours and gears

Computers started as basic calculators

## Various types of inputs include

-keyboard
-microphone
-mouse
-touch screen and many more

All the above inputs are stored in memory and then the processor take that information and process using different algorithms until it is ready to be output

The outputs vary based on what the computer is designed to do

Electric wires and circuits carry all the information inside a computer

Bit is the smallest piece of information a compurt can store. More wires means more bits so that we can store and represent more complex information

### Binary number system

-In the binary number system we only have 2 digits, 0 and 1 and and number can be repredented by them

-All types of information like text, images, and sound are also represented in numbers

-Software is any type program or code running computers

-The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is a component that used to communicate the hardware and the software

-Software tells the CPU what to do

### Operating system

-OS is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer.
